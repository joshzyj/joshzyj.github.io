I (Chinese: 张勇军[audio](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/name.m4a)) am a computational sociologist who develops and applies natural language processing and computer vision techniques with big data to study political, social, and organizational behavior. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I am currently working as an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology//people/faculty/Zhang.php) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also an affiliated faculty member in the Department of Asian and Asian American Studies and the AI Innovation Institute at Stony Brook University, as well as a research affiliate at New York University.

My previous work explored the dynamic relationship between social movements and socio-political changes both in the United States and globally. For instance, my undergraduate thesis was an ethnographic study of the state repression of petitioners in Beijing based on the participant observation of the Dong Zhuang village; my MA thesis used quantitative data to understand how relative deprivation influences protest propensity in China. Some of my social movement-related studies were published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/jomf.12419.pdf), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/Fiel-Zhang-2019_AJS.pdf), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf). I won the 2020 James Coleman Award from Sociology of Education Section at American Sociological Association and the 2021 SIM Best Paper Submission at Academy of Management. Currently, I am extending this line to visual representation of global protests by examining millions of images from newspapers worldwide with computer vision techniques and large language/vision models.

My current work focuses primarily on understanding mobility, segregation, and polarization in the U.S. I am using big data from FEC with corp data to track the polarization/partisanship trend in the US corporate leadership. I am using large-scale mobility data with administrative records to assess the antecedents and consequences of racial/partisan/income/cultural segregation in both residential and activity spaces. Some of these projects have been funded by the OVPR and IACS seed grants at Stony Brook University. Some of these ongoing studies have appeared in top journals such as Demography, RSF: Journal of Social Sciences, the Sociological Quarterly, Chinese Sociological Review, Socius, Scientific Reports, and Nature Humanities and Social Sciences Communications.

Recently, I am very interested in the following two big questions: How will AI shape the future of our society and how will our society shape the future of AI? To address these questions, I am starting to expand my research into new areas (Yes, I like new challenges), including the responsible usage of AI in addressing climate and health issues. Specifically, I am keen on exploring a significant question: How can we leverage the rapid advancements in AI to confront critical challenges such as conflict and violence and climate change to improve community resilience? If you are interested in these questions, feel free to reach out to me. I am seeking any potential collaboration in the near future. Building on large-scale multimodal social media data such as Twitter (now X) and YouTube, we are developing and applying large language and vision models to capture the psychological state of online social media users and further assess how it might shape online and offline behavior.  We are also interested in the discourse opportunity structure of climate change and environmental issues across various social media platforms over time and how AIs can help mitigate misinformation on these platforms. 

I am teaching Intro to Computational Social Science and Research Methods in Sociology at Stony Brook University. I co-edited a special issue on computational social science and Chinese societies for Chinese Sociological Review. I also co-organized the 2023 NYU Shanghai site for Summer Institute of Computational Social Science (SICSS).
