I (Chinese: 张勇军[audio](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/name.m4a)) am a computational sociologist who develops and applies natural language processing and computer vision techniques with big data to study political, social, and organizational behavior. I received my Sociology PhD in 2020 from the University of Arizona. I am currently working as an Assistant Professor of [Sociology](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/sociology//people/faculty/Zhang.php) and [Institute for Advanced Computational Science](https://iacs.stonybrook.edu/) at Stony Brook University. I am also a research affiliate at New York University.

My previous work explored the dynamic relationship between social movements and socio-political changes both in the United States and globally. These studies were published in [Journal of Marriage and Family](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/jomf.12419.pdf), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), [International Journal of Comparative Sociology](https://doi.org/10.1177/0020715219837752), [American Journal of Sociology](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/Fiel-Zhang-2019_AJS.pdf), and [PLoS One](https://yongjunzhang.com/files/pone.pdf). I won the 2020 James Coleman Award from Sociology of Education Section at American Sociological Association and the 2021 SIM Best Paper Submission at Academy of Management.

My current work focuses primarily on understanding mobility, segregation, and polarization in the U.S. I am using big data from FEC with corp data to track the polarization/partisanship trend in the US corporate leadership. I am using large-scale GPS data and near-population level voter and consumer records to assess the antecedents and consequences of racial/partisan/income/cultural segregation in both residential and activity spaces. This human mobility, segregation, and polarization project has been funded by an OVPR seed grant at Stony Brook University. I am also using deep learning methods to detect and monitor anti-AAPI hate speech and incidents as well as associated mental health issues (a direct result of polarization and xenophobia) from [Twitter since the COVID-19 outbreak](https://yongjunzhang.com/posts/2021/04/stopaapihate.md/). This project has been funded by a seed grant from IACS at Stony Brook University. Some of these ongoing studies have appeared in top journals such as Chinese Sociological Review, Socius, Scientific Reports, and Nature Humanities and Social Sciences Communications.

I am also starting to expand my research into new areas (Yes, I like new challenges), including the use of AI in addressing climate and health issues. Specifically, I am keen on exploring a significant question: How can we leverage the rapid advancements in AI to confront critical challenges such as conflict and violence, climate change, and the mental health crisis to improve community resilience? If you are interested in these questions, feel free to reach out to me. I am seeking any potential collaboration in the near future. Building on large-scale multimodal social media data such as Twitter (now X), YouTube, and TikTok, we are developing and applying large language and vision models to capture the psychological state of online social media users and further assess how it might shape online and offline behavior.  We are also interested in the discourse opportunity structure of enviromental justices across various social media platforms over time and how AIs can help mitigate misinformation on these platforms.

I am teaching Intro to Computational Social Science and Research Methods in Sociology at Stony Brook University. I co-edited a special issue on computational social science and Chinese societies for Chinese Sociological Review. I also co-organized the 2023 NYU Shanghai site for Summer Institute of Computational Social Science (SICSS).
